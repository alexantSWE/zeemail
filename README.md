# ZeeMail üìß

> A minimalist, secure, and configurable desktop email sender built with Python and Tkinter.

ZeeMail is a simple desktop application designed for one thing: sending emails quickly and reliably. It securely stores your credentials in your system's native keychain and provides a clean, distraction-free interface. It serves as a great example of a modern, object-oriented Tkinter application.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Simple & Clean UI**: A straightforward interface with "To", "Subject", and "Message" fields. No clutter.
*   **Secure Credential Storage**: Uses the `keyring` library to safely store your app password in the native OS keychain (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, Linux Secret Service/KWallet).
*   **Configurable SMTP**: Not just for Gmail! You can configure the SMTP server and port to work with any email provider that supports SMTP over SSL.
*   **Recipient Domain Validation**: Optionally checks if a recipient's email domain has valid MX records before sending, helping to catch typos.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Built with Python and the standard Tkinter library, it runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
*   **Clean Architecture**: The code is refactored into an object-oriented structure, separating UI (`EmailApp`), configuration (`ConfigManager`), and email logic (`EmailSender`) for better maintainability.

## üîß Requirements

*   **Python 3.8+**
*   **pip** (Python's package installer)
*   **A configured system keyring backend**:
    *   **Windows**: The Credential Manager is built-in.
    *   **macOS**: The Keychain is built-in.
    *   **Linux**: You need to have `secret-service` or `kwallet` installed and running. For example, on Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-0 gir1.2-secret-1`.

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get ZeeMail running on your local machine.

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexantSWE/zeemail.git
cd zeemail
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
*   On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
*   On Windows:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

**3. Install the dependencies:**
Create a file named `requirements.txt` in the project directory with the following content:
```
keyring
dnspython
```
Then, run the installation command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Run the Application:**
```bash
python main.py
```

**5. First-Time Configuration:**
When you first launch the app, you need to configure your email account.
*   Go to the `Account > Configure...` menu.
*   Enter your **email address**.
*   Enter your **App Password**.
    > **Important for Gmail Users**: You cannot use your regular Google password. You must generate an "App Password".
    > 1. Go to your Google Account > Security.
    > 2. Ensure 2-Step Verification is **ON**.
    > 3. Go to "App passwords".
    > 4. Select app: "Mail", Select device: "Other (Custom name)".
    > 5. Name it "ZeeMail" and click "Generate".
    > 6. Copy the 16-character password (without spaces) and paste it into the ZeeMail configuration window.
*   Verify the SMTP settings (defaults are for Gmail) and click **Save**.

Your credentials will be saved securely, and you're ready to send emails!

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear separation of concerns:

*   `main.py`: The main entry point for the application. It initializes and runs the `EmailApp`.
*   **`EmailApp` Class**: Manages the entire Tkinter GUI, including widget creation, layout, and handling user events (like button clicks).
*   **`ConfigManager` Class**: Handles all logic for loading and saving settings. It reads/writes `app_settings.json` for non-sensitive data and interacts with `keyring` for secure password storage.
*   **`EmailSender` Class**: Contains the logic for connecting to an SMTP server via `smtplib` to send emails and for performing DNS checks with `dnspython`.
*   `logo.gif`: The application icon.
*   `app_settings.json`: Automatically created to store non-sensitive settings like your email address and SMTP server configuration. **(Do not commit this file if you use a public repository)**.
*   `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python package dependencies for the project.
